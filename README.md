# UCSD Keebs Raffle Spinner
**Contributors: Colin Wang and Andrew Nguyen**

This repo is used to create a new raffle spinner to be used for UCSD Meets.

Based on the limitations on the whole wheel, we decided to go for a vertical wheel spinner approach.

Right now, it is coded in vanilla JS, but we will convert it to React soon.

***Current Progress***: Basic Functionalities are done, works for sample numbers

***TODO***: Make it look prettier LOL
